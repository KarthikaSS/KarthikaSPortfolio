    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>After I graduated Rice University, I moved to Austin to work as a medical scribe. In the process,I came to enjoy working with the electronic medical record system and coming up with ideas to improve the user interface. I started taking some online classes on coding, and I found that I had a passion for software development! In my free time I like volunteering for Austin Greyhound Adoption and baking. I love working with adoption volunteers to make sure each dog is placed into a good home!</p>
